Hello! I'm Matt, a PhD student in statistics at Boston University. I am primarily interested in probability theory. In particular, I am interested in stochastic and free stochastic analysis, Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. Recently, I have been researching bi-free probability theory and developing a theory to extend the Malliavin-Stein approach to it. I am also interested in the way in which stochastic anlaysis is used in training machine learning models and the asymptotic properties of stochastic algorithsm. I intend to work with Professor Solesne Bourgin or Professor Jonathan Huggins in the future. This site also contains a blog of topics that I am interested as well as various academic projects I have done. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns.
