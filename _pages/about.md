Hello! I'm Matt, a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University. I am primarily interested in the intersection of probability theory and functional analysis. In particular, I am interested in stochastic and free stochastic analysis, fourth moment phenomenona, Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. This site contains a blog with some of things I am thinking about, a list of publications and my CV. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments or just to say hello!
