Hello! I'm Matt, a PhD student in statistics at Boston University. I am primarily interested in the intersection of probability theory and functional analysis. In particular, I am interested in stochastic and free stochastic analysis, fourth moment phenomenona, Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. This site also contains a blog with some expository posts on several of these topics, publications and a my CV. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns.
