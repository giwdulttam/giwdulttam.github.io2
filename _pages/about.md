Hello! I'm Matt, a PhD student in statistics at Boston University. I am primarily interested in machine learning and stochastics processes. I am currently researching asymptotic properties of stochastic algorithsm with Professor Jonathan Huggins. This site also contains a blog of topics that I am interested as well as various academic projects I have done. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns.
