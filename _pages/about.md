Hello! I'm Matt, a PhD student in statistics at Boston University. I am primarily interested in probability theory. In particular, I am interested in stochastic and free stochastic analysis, Malliavin calculus and Stein's method. This site also contains a blog of topics that I am interested as well as various academic projects I have done. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, comments or concerns.
